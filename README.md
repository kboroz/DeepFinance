# DeepFinance

This GitHub-repository includes a couple of IPython-Notebooks which where executed to fullfil the requirements in the OpenCampus "Deep Learning Course " held in the summer term 2022.

Starting point is the "black_scholes_learning_prices.ipynb" Notebook where we trained a neural network to predict the prices.

In a simiar fashion the "ModelParameterVasicek.ipynb" shows how to use NeuralNetworks to train, learn and predict the parameters of a underlying stochastic process - here i.e. a so-called Vasicek-model.

The "black_scholes_learning_iv.ipynb" Notebook is the major part of the project. it includes some routines to calibrate model or market parameters of the implied volatility

The "DeepHedging.ipynb" is just an Add-On-Notebookwhich should and will be continued in the future to train a neural network for hedging purposes.
